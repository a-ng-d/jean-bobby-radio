# Jean-bobby Radio
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, with my teammate in the UX team, we were used to listen to our Spotify collaborative playlist. A batch of various masterpieces from different personalities. There are some 90's hits: Trip Hop, Alternative rock, House‚Ä¶ Some 80's hits: Goth, New Wave‚Ä¶ Around 500 tracks we listened to everyday. And yet, a virus has co me, and the remote work was the new order. We were distributed. The problem is we cannot use Spotify as a web radio, in order to listen together to our music and react on it. Make our own web radio allows us to retrieve this office atmosphere: Jean-Bobby Radio.
